    "- Computation of additional properties based on the matrix elements, e.g. molecular frame (MF) and aligned frame (AF) observables. (Some of these are already possible in ePS directly, e.g. [`OrientCro` for MF computations](https://web.archive.org/web/20160311205849fw_/http://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/lucchese/ePolyScat.E3.manual/OrientCro.html)).\n",
