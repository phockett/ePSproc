Nonetheless, this tutorial aims to go over some of the key features/uses of ePS for such problems - as far as my own usage goes - and provide an introduction and resource to new users."

    "- Fundamental molecular properties, these can be compared with experimentally obtained values (see [platfrom development for quantum metrology with photoelectrons notes](https://phockett.github.io/ePSdata/about.html#Scientific)).\n",

    "- Provides a minimal dataset which can be piped into further analysis/processing routines.\n",
    "- Computation of additional properties based on the matrix elements, e.g. molecular frame (MF) and aligned frame (AF) observables. (Some of these are already possible in ePS directly, e.g. `OrientCro` [for MF computations](https://epolyscat.droppages.com/OrientCro)).\n",
