Pip, Anaconda and Venv environment testing
02/10/20

After breaking conda env *again*, it's time to make this work better...
(This issue after installing then uninstalling Plotly Jupyter Lab extension - weird.)

- Current requirements.txt should be (roughly) minimal working env for ePSproc, with known working versions.
- Set up minimal requirments.txt based on current env, without versions.
- Version with Jupyter too?

Good guide: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48787250/set-up-virtualenv-using-a-requirements-txt-generated-by-conda

Conda

conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt

conda env export --from-history


Testing on Stimpy, 02/10/20

conda create --name epsdev1.3min --file requirements_minimal_unversioned.txt
 > Missing channels for some packages - can this be set in requirements.txt?
 > Can set in .yml


Testing for local installs and pkg versions etc.

  conda create --name epsInstallTest --python=3.7

See "installation_notes_051120.rst" for more, this should end up as main installation guide.
