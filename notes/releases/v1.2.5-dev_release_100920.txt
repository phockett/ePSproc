# v1.2.5-dev: Geometric code for AF, epsData interface, wavefunction plotting

Updated v1.2.5 source, with new functionality and bug fixes from March - Sept. 2020, but still back-compatible. The next release (v1.3.0) will include significant restructuring which will likely break old code. New additions in this version are now working & tested, but still need some work & tidying up.

([This version from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ePSproc/1.2.5.dev0/).)

# Main additions since v1.2.5 release:

The main change is the addition of [tensor-based BLM computations](https://epsproc.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.5-dev/methods/geometric_method_dev_260220_090420_tidy.html), which are now verified, and much faster than previous codes. There are some new classes too, although these are still in the development stages.
