# 27/10/22: minimal version for CI and testing. Note spherical_functions needs installation via Conda or manually, but fails with pip+pypi currently.
#           Run `pip install git+git://github.com/moble/spherical_functions`
#           See https://epsproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/etc/installation_notes_051120.html#using-pip
# 12/08/21: this version has Xarray & Seaborn pinned to versions prior to package breaking changes, to be fixed!
#           UPDATE 27/10/22: Xarray up to v2022.3.0 (March 2022) now OK, but IO issues with newer versions.
# 20/04/21: unversioned requirements testing
